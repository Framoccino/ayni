The system that rewards you for living more humanly

# 🧿 AYNI – The Human Dashboard

AYNI is a decentralized platform that rewards people for living more human lives. By anonymously sharing real-world data — from movement and rest to digital behavior — users receive royalties in tokens that can be exchanged for services, knowledge, food, and experiences.

This repository contains the technical roadmap, core principles, and contribution guidelines to build and scale the AYNI ecosystem.

## 📌 What is AYNI?

AYNI is a new economic system where your data, your talents, and your natural rhythm become your income.

- Users share data **anonymously** (sleep, GPS, screen time, etc.)
- Every time their data is **used by an AI model, researcher, or system**, they receive **royalties**
- Each user has a **dashboard** showing their earnings, contribution, and growth
- AYNI Tokens are used to exchange real value — peer-to-peer — in a human marketplace

We believe individuality is collective wealth. AYNI is designed to prove it.

## 🔧 Architecture (Phase 1 – MVP)

### Frontend:
- **Notion-based dashboard (simulated)**
- Future: Web3-native dashboard in React or Flutter

### Backend:
- Simulated logic for royalties and contributions
- User data stored as anonymized JSON objects
- Future: Supabase/Firebase → IPFS → zk proofs for verification

### Token:
- ERC-20 AYNI Token (testnet initially)
- Distributed proportionally to data usage value
- Exchangeable for goods/services

### Privacy:
- Anonymous identity via hashed UUID or wallet
- No personal data stored directly
- Consent-based modular sharing system

## 🛣 Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1 – MVP (NOW)
- [x] Manifesto and human philosophy
- [x] Landing page + dashboard mockups
- [x] Notion-based data dashboard (manual simulation)
- [ ] GitHub repo and contributor system
- [ ] Early social posts and calls to collaborators

### 🔜 Phase 2 – Token + Validation Layer
- Talent growth = value creation
- Peer-to-peer feedback & recognition
- Token minted by actual use and community validation

### 🌀 Phase 3 – Marketplace + Human Mesh
- Fully decentralized identity
- Marketplace powered by AYNI Tokens
- Optional connections between dashboards (anonymity preserved)

## 🧠 Principles

- Your data is **your right**
- You are rewarded based on **real impact**
- Your growth is **guided, not gamified**
- You choose your rhythm, focus, and role
