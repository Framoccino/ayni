# AYNI Tokenomics

AYNI uses a native token (AYNI) that represents the value of human contribution.

## Token Use Cases
- Royalties for shared data
- Rewards for talent development
- Currency in the AYNI marketplace
- Peer-to-peer payments

## Distribution Model
- 65% → User rewards (data + talent)
- 15% → Community treasury (grants, incentives)
- 10% → Developers & contributors
- 5% → Ecosystem partnerships
- 5% → Reserve

## Minting Logic
Tokens are only minted when:
- Data is used ethically (tracked on-chain or logged)
- Talent creates real value (peer-validated)
